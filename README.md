# Tweeter-Sentiment-analysis
During this project was developed three machine learning and data mining methods to solve the problem of classifying the polarity of tweets (binary classes) using the Sentiment140 dataset. This work explores the use of the logistic regression classifier model and two neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The practice of aiming to deliver a high accuracy score whilst pre-processing and fine-tuning the hyperparameters of these models allows us to become familiar with each of these algorithms and its nuances both theoretically and in practice when applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The results show that the CNN model was the best performer in terms of prediction accuracy and had the shortest run time.
